MeasureImageQuality:[module_num:3|svn_version:'Unknown'|variable_revision_number:6|show_window:False|notes:['In addition to the more general image QC features, collect the thresholds for the DNA and RNA images. We use these two channels because the DNA image is used for nuclei identification and the RNA image is used for cell body identification. Examining the histogram of these values is often helpful in setting the lower threshold bound, as well as getting a sense of what outliers look like.', '', 'Note that different threshold methods are calculated for each channel, although more could be added. Also note that even though the channels will be illumination corrected in the feature extraction pipeline, we have not found that it affects QC assessment substantially.']|batch_state:array([], dtype=uint8)|enabled:True|wants_pause:False]
